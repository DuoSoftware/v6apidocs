	<h3 style="font-size: 17px;font-weight: 300;line-height: 33px;color: #000;" >DuoWorld enables Application Developers and Business Entities to develop and deploy Cloud Application Systems driven with multi-tenancy. DuoWorld serves as an Application Development Platform as a Service (PaaS) which provides a Developer Studio for HTML5 application development. DuoWorld also gives a Data Service Layer for the developers to develop the back-end of the Enterprise Applications. This reduces the work and effort taken to implement a system with multi-tenancy.
	DuoWorld is a PaaS which enables the developers to develop apps and host the developed apps in a “developer portal” for public access. Developers can also sell their apps in the marketplace to earn profit and promote their apps.
	Users can simply go to <a href="www.duoworld.com">www.duoworld.com </a>and register with their basic information. There are several types of accounts which can be selected by the user based on the requirements. To use apps only, he/she can join a public portal and use the public apps which are published by the developers. To develop and host apps, then he/she can upgrade the account to get access to the Development Studio. All the developer tenants are interconnected using the “Cloud Event Bus” to provide a universal Development Platform.
